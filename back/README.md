The back end will receive base 64 encoded images for the products and their descriptions.
I consider essential:
-the gender
-the type
-the price
-the keywords
-the image string

##TODO:
- Add a way to upload images to server through request, and add them to the images field of a DB item, by path.
- Front End start development
